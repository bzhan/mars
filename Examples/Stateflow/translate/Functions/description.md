## Examples of functions and graphical functions

### Function1

* This example tests function with one input argument and one return value.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B

### Function2

* This example tests function with multiple input arguments and multiple return values.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B

### Function3

* This example tests working with one dimensional arrays.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B

### Function4

* This example tests special functions (min and max).
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B

### Function5

* This example tests working with two dimensional arrays, as well as conditionals.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B

### Function6

* This example tests copying with arrays. Note this does not result in aliasing.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B

### GraphicalFunction1

* This example demonstrates a loop to find the first nonzero element of a. The expected result is 3, which will enable a transition from A to B.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B

### GraphicalFunction2

* This example demonstrates a loop to copy part of an array to another array.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - set
  - set
  - set
  - en_B
  - 100 200 300 0 0

### GraphicalFunction3

* This example demonstrates graphical functions with multiple input parameters and return values.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - en_B
  - 4
  - 9

### GraphicalFunction4

* This example tests two calls of graphical functions in the same condition, as well as return of boolean values. The first return value should be true and the second should be false, allowing the transition to be carried out, reaching state B.
* Expected result:
  - en_A
  - ack
  - ack
  - ack
  - ack
  - ack
  - en_B
