abstract="We report on our recent experience in applying formal methods to the verification of a descent guidance control program of a lunar lander. The powered descent process of the lander gives a specific hybrid system (HS), i.e. a sampled-data control system composed of the physical plant and the embedded control program. Due to its high complexity, verification of such a system is very hard. In the paper, we show how this problem can be solved by several different techniques including simulation, bounded model checking (BMC) and theorem proving, using the tools Simulink/Stateflow, iSAT-ODE and Flow*, and HHL Prover, respectively. In particular, for the theorem-proving approach to work, we study the invariant generation problem for HSs with general elementary functions. As a preliminary attempt, we perform verification by focusing on one of the 6 phases, i.e. the slow descent phase, of the powered descent process. Through such verification, trustworthiness of the lunar lander's control program is enhanced.",
